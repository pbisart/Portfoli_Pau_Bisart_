            <p class="explicacio_about"> 
I am a high school student of 3D animation, games and interactive environments, I always liked to play, and i saw that the time had come to learn to create and develop my own games, also with the animation.
Last year I did an average course of image and sound in Lleida, in which they helped me to see what I wanted to do in the future.
This year I learned many things about these issues and I would love to continue learning and training. </p>
